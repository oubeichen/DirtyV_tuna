	  Zcache doubles RAM efficiency while providing a significant
	  performance boosts on many workloads.  Zcache uses
	  compression and an in-kernel implementation of transcendent
	  memory to store clean page cache pages and swap in RAM,
	  providing a noticeable reduction in disk I/O.

# Depends on not-yet-upstreamed mm patches to export end_swap_bio_write and
# __add_to_swap_cache, and implement __swap_writepage (which is swap_writepage
# without the frontswap call. When these are in-tree, the dependency on
# BROKEN can be removed
config ZCACHE_WRITEBACK
	bool "Allow compressed swap pages to be writtenback to swap disk"
	depends on ZCACHE=y && BROKEN
	default n
	help
	  Zcache caches compressed swap pages (and other data) in RAM which
	  often improves performance by avoiding I/O's due to swapping.
	  In some workloads with very long-lived large processes, it can
	  instead reduce performance.  Writeback decompresses zcache-compressed
	  pages (in LRU order) when under memory pressure and writes them to
	  the backing swap disk to ameliorate this problem.  Policy driving
	  writeback is still under development.
